<p>Carter Perry Bailey LLP was formed in 2009. Our founding members were <a href="/people/stephen-carter/">Stephen Carter</a>, <a href="/people/bill-perry/">Bill Perry</a> and <a href="/people/bernadette-bailey/">Bernadette Bailey</a>. Together, they had a vision to create a niche specialist practice in the City of London, based on traditional values but utilising modern techniques. With encouragement and support from their clients, they created Carter Perry Bailey LLP in May 2009, practicing from our Lloyd’s Avenue office.</p>

<p>The founding partners specialise in insurance and reinsurance (both contentious and non-contentious), commercial litigation, arbitration and trust & fiduciary disputes.  These remain the firm’s primary focus.</p>

<p><a href="/people/william-sturge/">William Sturge</a>, a Partner in the insurance & reinsurance group of another large City firm, shared a similar vision, and moved to join us in 2010.  Since then, respected senior insurance and reinsurance lawyers have also joined the firm as consultants. <a href="/people/anthony-rose/">Anthony Rose</a> and <a href="/people/hugh-bohling/">Hugh Bohling</a> (the latter with his niche corporate insurance practice), bolstered our corporate and commercial capabilities. <a href="/people/alan-bannister/">Alan Bannister</a> (with his “Advantage Regulation” consultancy) boosted our regulatory offering to clients. <a href="/people/robert-harrison/">Robert Harrison</a> added further insurance/reinsurance experience and most recently <a href="/people/joseph-sutton/">Joseph Sutton</a> brought us employment law expertise. In 2015, <a href="/people/mark-aizlewood/">Mark Aizlewood</a> and <a href="/people/simon-thomas/">Simon Thomas</a> also joined our partnership bringing a professional and financial risks practice, which Mark now heads.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in 2010, we were honoured to be invited to join the prestigious <a href="/international-networks/">Insuralex</a> network as its exclusive UK member.  In 2012, Bill Perry, was elected Insuralex President, a two year term of office.  In the same year, Bill Perry was elected President of the <a href="/international-networks/" target="_blank">International Association of Defense Counsel</a> (the first non-American to hold the post), just one of the international and London Market bodies in which our partners are now active.</p>

<p>Since the firm’s formation, our expertise has been recognised each year by, amongst others, Chambers Guide and Legal 500. In 2010, a year after the firm was formed and following our success representing AGF Insurance in the seminal House of Lords reinsurance case <em>AGF & WASA v Lexington</em>, Carter Perry Bailey was “Highly Commended” in the Legal Business awards, Insurance Team of the Year category.  In each year since, both our firm or our individual lawyers have been recognised with a number of other <a href="/awards/">awards</a> and with entries in Chambers Guide and Legal 500, by Who’s Who Legal and Thompson Reuters “Super Lawyers”.</p>
